# Welcome to the Hikers App 2.0

The Hikers App is a place for hikers to find trailheads and hikes, as well as share their own hikes. In this pared-down 2.0 version, users can view trailheads and view hikes by trailhead, see abbreviated or expanded hike information, and submit their own hikes. This single page web application was created using Rails as an API on the backend, and JavaScript to handle all client-side functionality (rendering and updating in the DOM, handling form submissions, making fetch requests to communicate with the Rails API on the backend, etc).

This app was developed as a portfolio project for Flatiron School's Online Software Engineering Program. The CSS styling was created with Bulma.

## Installation
* Clone this repo
* `cd` into the backend directory
* Run bundle
* Run rails s
* Either right click the index.html file to open in browser, or cd into the frontend directory and use bash to run the frontend
* To explore the Rails API, open your browser to localhost:3000 and use RESTful routes to view the trailhead index and nested hike indices
